# # Odin Query Language (OQL) Tutorial: Analyzing a Transportation Network

Welcome to the tutorial on using the Odin Query Language (OQL) for analyzing and
querying transportation networks. This tutorial will demonstrate how to model
and query a city's transportation system using OQL, focusing on stations and
their connections. It will provide insights into more complex aspects of OQL.

## Prerequisites

- Completion of the basic OQL tutorial or equivalent knowledge.
- Understanding of graph database concepts and how they apply to transportation
  networks.

## Step 1: Defining Transportation Entities and Relationships

Firstly, we need to define the entities (stations) and the relationships
(connections) within our transportation network.

```oql
add Entity Station;
add Relationship CONNECTS;
```

> **Note:** In OQL, entities like `Station` are defined in CamelCase, while
> relationships like `CONNECTS` are in UPPER_CASE.

## Step 2: Creating Stations

We will create several stations, each representing a node in our transportation
graph.

```oql
create (stationA:Station {name: "Station A", line: "Red"});
create (stationB:Station {name: "Station B", line: "Red"});
create (stationC:Station {name: "Station C", line: "Green"});
```

> **Tip:** Assign unique identifiers to each station for easy reference in
> subsequent statements. For example, `stationA` is the identifier for Station A
> in this tutorial.

## Step 3: Establishing Connections

Next, we'll establish connections between these stations, representing the
routes in our transportation network.

```oql
create stationA-[:CONNECTS]->stationB;
create stationB-[:CONNECTS]->stationC;
```

> Ensure the direction of the `CONNECTS` relationship accurately represents the
> actual direction of travel between stations.

## Step 4: Querying Routes

Now, let's perform queries to analyze routes and connections between stations.
For example, to find a route from Station A to Station C:

```oql
match (start:Station {name: "Station A"})-[:CONNECTS*]->(end:Station {name: "Station C"}) return start, end;
```

This query uses a variable length path (`[:CONNECTS*]`) to find all possible
connections from Station A to Station C.

> **Advanced Concept:** Variable length paths in OQL allow for flexible querying
> of routes with an unspecified number of intermediate stops.

## Conclusion

This tutorial covered advanced features of OQL, focusing on modeling and
querying a transportation network. You've learned how to define entities and
relationships specific to transportation, create stations and their connections,
and perform complex route queries.

> **Final Tip:** Experiment with different types of queries to fully leverage
> OQL's capabilities in handling complex graph-based data structures. Regularly
> consult the OQL documentation for updates and advanced features.

Happy querying! 🎉
