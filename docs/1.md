# Odin Query Language (OQL) Tutorial: Analyzing Social Networks

Welcome to this tutorial on using the Odin Query Language (OQL) to analyze
social networks. This tutorial is designed to help you understand the basics of
OQL and how it can be used to represent and query relationships within a social
network.

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of graph databases and their principles.
- Familiarity with the concept of entities and relationships.

## Step 1: Defining Entities and Relationships

In OQL, we begin by defining the types of entities and relationships we will be
working with. In the context of a social network, our primary entity is a
`Person` and the primary relationship is `FRIEND`.

```oql
add Entity Person;
add Relationship FRIEND;
```

> **Note:** Entity types are always in CamelCase, while relationship types are
> in UPPER_CASE.

## Step 2: Creating Entities (People)

Next, we create individual people in our network. Each person is an entity with
properties like name and age.

```oql
create (alice:Person {name: "Alice", age: 30});
create (bob:Person {name: "Bob", age: 35});
```

> **Warning:** Ensure that the entity type matches the defined type (`Person` in
> this case). Mismatches in entity type names will lead to errors.

## Step 3: Establishing Relationships

After creating entities, we establish relationships between them. Here, we'll
create friendship links.

```oql
create (charlie:Person {name: "Charlie", age: 25});
create alice-[:FRIEND]->bob;
create bob-[:FRIEND]->charlie;
```

> **Note:** Relationships can be uni-directional (`-[]->`) or bi-directional
> (`->[]<-`). Choose based on the nature of the relationship.

## Step 4: Querying the Network

To analyze our social network, we use `match` statements. For example, to find
all of Alice's friends:

```oql
match (:Person {name: "Alice"})-[:FRIEND]->(friend:Person); return friend;
```

This query matches all `Person` entities that are friends with Alice and returns
them.

## Conclusion

This tutorial covered the basics of using OQL to analyze social networks. You
learned how to define entities and relationships, create individuals and their
connections, and query these relationships. As you continue, remember to
experiment with different queries to fully understand the capabilities of OQL.

> **Final Tip:** Regularly refer back to the OQL documentation for updates,
> additional features, and detailed explanations of more complex
> functionalities.

Happy querying! 🎉
